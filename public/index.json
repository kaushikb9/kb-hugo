[{"content":"Last week, I was chatting with a small group of folks‚Äîearly career to mid-level‚Äîtrying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop. The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. We‚Äôve all been there.\nSo I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster‚Äînot just in scope or title, but in influence. Because that‚Äôs what really compounds.\nIf there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click‚Äîor stall.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people. People who raise your bar. The right environment won‚Äôt just support your growth ‚Äî it‚Äôll demand it.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high.\nYou can only build influence step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure it‚Äôs obvious. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you‚Äîcustomers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note ‚Äî highlights, lowlights, help needed. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they‚Äôd make a comment or offer help.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks‚Äîearly career to mid-level‚Äîtrying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. We‚Äôve all been there.\nSo I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster‚Äînot just in scope or title, but in influence. Because that‚Äôs what really compounds.\nIf there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click‚Äîor stall.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people. People who raise your bar. The right environment won‚Äôt just support your growth ‚Äî it‚Äôll demand it.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high.\nYou can only build influence step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure it‚Äôs obvious. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you‚Äîcustomers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note ‚Äî highlights, lowlights, help needed. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they‚Äôd make a comment or offer help.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks - early career to mid-level‚Äîtrying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. We‚Äôve all been there.\nSo I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster‚Äînot just in scope or title, but in influence. Because that‚Äôs what really compounds.\nIf there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click‚Äîor stall.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people. People who raise your bar. The right environment won‚Äôt just support your growth ‚Äî it‚Äôll demand it.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high.\nYou can only build influence step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure it‚Äôs obvious. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you‚Äîcustomers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note ‚Äî highlights, lowlights, help needed. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they‚Äôd make a comment or offer help.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks - early career to mid-level‚Äîtrying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I‚Äôve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you‚Äôll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. We‚Äôve all been there.\nSo I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster‚Äînot just in scope or title, but in influence. Because that‚Äôs what really compounds.\nIf there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click‚Äîor stall.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people. People who raise your bar. The right environment won‚Äôt just support your growth ‚Äî it‚Äôll demand it.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high.\nYou can only build influence step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure it‚Äôs obvious. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you‚Äîcustomers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note ‚Äî highlights, lowlights, help needed. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they‚Äôd make a comment or offer help.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks - early career to mid-level, trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. We‚Äôve all been there.\nSo I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster‚Äînot just in scope or title, but in influence. Because that‚Äôs what really compounds.\nIf there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click‚Äîor stall.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people. People who raise your bar. The right environment won‚Äôt just support your growth ‚Äî it‚Äôll demand it.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high.\nYou can only build influence step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure it‚Äôs obvious. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you‚Äîcustomers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note ‚Äî highlights, lowlights, help needed. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they‚Äôd make a comment or offer help.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level, trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I‚Äôve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you‚Äôll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. We‚Äôve all been there.\nSo I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster‚Äînot just in scope or title, but in influence. Because that‚Äôs what really compounds.\nIf there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click‚Äîor stall.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people. People who raise your bar. The right environment won‚Äôt just support your growth ‚Äî it‚Äôll demand it.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high.\nYou can only build influence step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure it‚Äôs obvious. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you‚Äîcustomers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note ‚Äî highlights, lowlights, help needed. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they‚Äôd make a comment or offer help.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. We‚Äôve all been there.\nSo I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster‚Äînot just in scope or title, but in influence. Because that‚Äôs what really compounds.\nIf there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click‚Äîor stall.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people. People who raise your bar. The right environment won‚Äôt just support your growth ‚Äî it‚Äôll demand it.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high.\nYou can only build influence step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure it‚Äôs obvious. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you‚Äîcustomers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note ‚Äî highlights, lowlights, help needed. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they‚Äôd make a comment or offer help.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I‚Äôve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you‚Äôll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles.

Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click‚Äîor stall.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people. People who raise your bar. The right environment won‚Äôt just support your growth ‚Äî it‚Äôll demand it.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high.\nYou can only build influence step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure it‚Äôs obvious. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you‚Äîcustomers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note ‚Äî highlights, lowlights, help needed. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they‚Äôd make a comment or offer help.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best.

The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click‚Äîor stall.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people. People who raise your bar. The right environment won‚Äôt just support your growth ‚Äî it‚Äôll demand it.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high.\nYou can only build influence step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure it‚Äôs obvious. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you‚Äîcustomers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note ‚Äî highlights, lowlights, help needed. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they‚Äôd make a comment or offer help.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people. People who raise your bar. The right environment won‚Äôt just support your growth ‚Äî it‚Äôll demand it.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high.\nYou can only build influence step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure it‚Äôs obvious. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you‚Äîcustomers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note ‚Äî highlights, lowlights, help needed. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they‚Äôd make a comment or offer help.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I‚Äôve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you‚Äôll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people. People who raise your bar. The right environment won‚Äôt just support your growth ‚Äî it‚Äôll demand it.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high.\nYou can only build influence step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure it‚Äôs obvious. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you‚Äîcustomers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note ‚Äî highlights, lowlights, help needed. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they‚Äôd make a comment or offer help.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high.\nYou can only build influence step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure it‚Äôs obvious. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you‚Äîcustomers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note ‚Äî highlights, lowlights, help needed. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they‚Äôd make a comment or offer help.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I‚Äôve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you‚Äôll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. You can only build influence step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure it‚Äôs obvious. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you‚Äîcustomers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note ‚Äî highlights, lowlights, help needed. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they‚Äôd make a comment or offer help.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, influence cant be built overnight. IMO it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure it‚Äôs obvious. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you‚Äîcustomers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note ‚Äî highlights, lowlights, help needed. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they‚Äôd make a comment or offer help.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I‚Äôve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you‚Äôll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles.

If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure it‚Äôs obvious. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you‚Äîcustomers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note ‚Äî highlights, lowlights, help needed. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they‚Äôd make a comment or offer help.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best.

The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you‚Äîcustomers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note ‚Äî highlights, lowlights, help needed. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they‚Äôd make a comment or offer help.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you ‚Äî customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note ‚Äî highlights, lowlights, help needed. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they‚Äôd make a comment or offer help.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I‚Äôve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you‚Äôll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note ‚Äî highlights, lowlights, help needed. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they‚Äôd make a comment or offer help.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they‚Äôd make a comment or offer help.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I‚Äôve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you‚Äôll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would make a comment or offer help.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would make a comment, or offer help.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I‚Äôve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you‚Äôll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles.

Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best.

The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project ‚Äî anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to a project - anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I‚Äôve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you‚Äôll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to few specific projects - anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to few specific projects - anchor yourself to the problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I‚Äôve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you‚Äôll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to few specific projects - anchor yourself to problems. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to few specific projects - anchor yourself to problems that need solving. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help ‚Äî without waiting for permission.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I‚Äôve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you‚Äôll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles.

Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to few specific projects - anchor yourself to problems that need solving. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help without waiting for things to be assigned.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to few specific projects - anchor yourself to problems that need solving. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help without waiting for things to be assigned.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to few specific projects - anchor yourself to problems that need solving. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about. They notice, they ask, they poke, they offer to help without waiting for things to be assigned.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I‚Äôve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you‚Äôll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to few specific projects - anchor yourself to problems that need solving. Don‚Äôt box yourself in by thinking ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they are allowed to care about.\nAt the core of all this is being proactive, a high sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt just attach yourself to specific projects‚Äîanchor yourself to the problems that need solving. Don‚Äôt box yourself in with ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I‚Äôve worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they‚Äôre allowed to care about.\nAt the core of all this is proactivity, a sharp sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I‚Äôve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you‚Äôll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt box yourself in with ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I‚Äôve worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they‚Äôre allowed to care about.\nAt the core of all this is proactivity, a sharp sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt box yourself in with ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I‚Äôve worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they‚Äôre allowed to care about.\nAt the core of all this is proactivity, a sharp sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I‚Äôve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you‚Äôll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles.

If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt box yourself in with ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they‚Äôre allowed to care about.\nAt the core of all this is proactivity, a sharp sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt box yourself in with ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they‚Äôre allowed to care about.\nAt the core of all this is proactivity, a sharp sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt box yourself in with ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they‚Äôre allowed to care about. At the core of all this is proactivity, a sharp sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I‚Äôve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you‚Äôll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Don‚Äôt box yourself in with ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they‚Äôre allowed to care about. At the core of all this is proactivity, a sharp sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it. Don‚Äôt box yourself in with ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they‚Äôre allowed to care about. At the core of all this is proactivity, a sharp sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I‚Äôve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you‚Äôll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like.\nAnd yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it. Don‚Äôt box yourself in with ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they‚Äôre allowed to care about. At the core of all this is proactivity, a sharp sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. And yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it. Don‚Äôt box yourself in with ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they‚Äôre allowed to care about. At the core of all this is proactivity, a sharp sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I‚Äôve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you‚Äôll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles.

If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. And yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything ‚Äî but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it. Don‚Äôt box yourself in with ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they‚Äôre allowed to care about. At the core of all this is proactivity, a sharp sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best.

The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. And yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything - but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it. Don‚Äôt box yourself in with ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they‚Äôre allowed to care about. At the core of all this is proactivity, a sharp sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you. It‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Improve how the team works, not just what it ships. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. And yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything - but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it. Don‚Äôt box yourself in with ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they‚Äôre allowed to care about. At the core of all this is proactivity, a sharp sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you.\nIt‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I‚Äôve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you‚Äôll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what‚Äôs helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster\nIf there is one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That‚Äôs where things start to click.\nStart with your environment. If Mondays feel heavy, maybe that‚Äôs the first thing to fix. Work with smart, high-energy people - people who raise your bar. The right environment will demand you to grow.\nThe other big unlock is influence. It‚Äôs not about being the loudest in the room. It‚Äôs about making people want to listen when you speak. It‚Äôs about building enough credibility and trust that others come to you when the stakes are high. Btw, IMO influence cant be built overnight, it compounds step by step:\nPersonal Excellence ‚Äì Own your craft. Be known for something. Team Impact ‚Äì Enable the team to be more efficient, and ship faster. Org Influence ‚Äì Be bold and decisive. Help shape the culture. It‚Äôs also important to understand that it‚Äôs not your job to do everything. It‚Äôs your job to make sure things get done. Know when to push, and when to ask for help. You don‚Äôt get extra points for burning out alone. Ownership means you made it happen, regardless of who else was involved.\nIf you want to get to the next level, make sure you are intentional about it. Don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôll happen just because you‚Äôve been around long enough. Ask your manager what problems they want solved. Ask what ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like. And yes, always overcommunicate. There were times I worked on some of the most critical projects and my manager had no idea what I was doing. I would send a short Monday morning note on how things are progressing and where I need help. Didn‚Äôt matter if they read it or not. Once in a while, something would catch their eye and they would share their feedback.\nFinally, be curious. Keep a quiet eye on what‚Äôs happening around you - customers complaining, cross-team friction, tech debt piling up. You don‚Äôt need to solve everything - but when something drops, be the one who picks it up and runs with it. Don‚Äôt box yourself in with ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt my problem‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else will handle it.‚Äù Some of the most impactful people I have worked with are the ones who don‚Äôt draw boundaries around what they‚Äôre allowed to care about. At the core of all this is proactivity, a sharp sense of urgency to move the needle, and the ability to influence the people around you.\nIt‚Äôs how you show up, create momentum, and help others move faster.\nBe the person who makes the team better just by being there. The one who‚Äôs trusted with the messy problems. The one they don‚Äôt want to lose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/influence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the ‚Äújust keep grinding‚Äù loop.

In my current role, I lead 2 charters - tooling for customer success and improve engineering productivity. Over the last few months, we have been carefully exploring how AI can play a meaningful role across both.\nWhen automating Customer support, the tolerance for error is low. We can‚Äôt afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters - understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their frustrations. The customer usually reaches out after they‚Äôve tried everything else. It‚Äôs not enough to be correct - the customer needs to feel that their concern is actually being addressed.\nOn the other side, when building for internal users, especially engineering, we have more room to experiment and can take some risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully. We want to optimise for speed and cost - not just build some gimmicky features.\nSome experiments worked, some didn‚Äôt. Along the way, I started building a mental model for where AI can really shine, where humans still matter, and where the combo works best. So I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nQ3: üß± Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn‚Äôt really need AI or humans. They only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans exist in the loop only because the product didn‚Äôt support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates. These problems don‚Äôt need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Check eligibility\u0026rdquo; - should be a button on the dashboard \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; - validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; - runbook config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn‚Äôt have to.\nQ4: ü§ñ The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There is a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is my refund taking so long?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am unable to understand the documentation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; The AI gets it right often enough but sometimes it can afford to do small mistakes. These are low-risk, high-reward. Here are some more examples that can do well for improving dev experience:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn‚Äôt need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: üß† The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo has a compounding effect. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a smart human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev can focus on design decisions and edge cases by offloading boilerplate and tests A fresher can jump into fixing complex production issues In many ways, LLMs feel like that one super-enthu junior engineer - smart and fast, but needs direction. They can draft, summarize, connect dots, and suggest next steps but could sometimes make mistakes. When paired with experienced humans, the combo is unbeatable, else they can drift easily.\nQ2: üëÄ The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You‚Äôd think everything eventually moves towards AI, right? But there are still cases where humans can outperform AI - not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn‚Äôt obvious.\nA customer has asked a simple question but is frustrated because there are other tickets which are still open A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if AI can give the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn‚Äôt what is said, but how and when it‚Äôs said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in the 1st, 3rd or the 4th quadrant - but they often end up in the 2nd quadrant aka The Judgement Zone due to missing context. Imagine a customer asking a straightforward question but the AI gives a templated answer or asks for more details like a screenshot or logs or worse - replicate the scenario. The customer is already frustrated and now they have to do more tasks to get their issue resolve. If that context was pre-fetched, the same problem could have easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nWhile I was writing this post, a talk by Andrej Karpathy was doing the rounds. It reinforced a few things we have been seeing on the ground, especially around the role of AI agents and the importance of context. He talks about AI agents as the next layer of abstraction and how chaining tools and memory into them is what makes them powerful. He also makes a great point about designing for LLMs, not just using them as a drop-in replacement for humans. In other words: don‚Äôt just give the model a messy interface or complex tool and expect magic - build clean, clear scaffolds around the model‚Äôs strengths. That resonates with our experience too. Problems in the LLM Sweet Spot work well because we‚Äôve shaped the inputs and constraints to help the model succeed. He also talks about human-in-the-loop where we need to design systems where users can verify, edit, and guide the AI.\nEvolving with AI We haven‚Äôt cracked all of this. Some parts are still rough. But thinking in this way has helped us ask better questions and build towards stronger answers. This model helped me pause and rethink how I should be strategising to leverage AI better. There is no doubt we are heading toward an AI-first future, but I think we still have a year or two where humans play a critical role ‚Äî helping make AI agents smarter, faster, and more useful. It‚Äôs better to accept that and start upskilling ourselves for an exciting future.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: \u0026ldquo;Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\u0026rdquo; That shift means rethinking how we structure inputs, build feedback interfaces, store memory, and even write docs.\nAs Andrej said in his talk: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to use LLMs, you want to build for them.‚Äù\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-and-humans/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAI is everywhere ‚Äî but figuring out where it actually helps (and where it doesn‚Äôt) is still very much a work in progress.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I‚Äôve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere‚Äôs a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I‚Äôve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don‚Äôt get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there‚Äôs more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or ‚Äúf**k you‚Äù money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my passion?‚Äù, I‚Äôll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I‚Äôm not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I‚Äôve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it‚Äôs the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don‚Äôt I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven‚Äôt done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24‚Äì48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn‚Äôt to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one‚Äôs watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that‚Äôll say something I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you‚Äôre in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I‚Äôll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.
