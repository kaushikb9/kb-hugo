[{"content":"In my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\nTo solve customer issues at scale To improve org productivity, especially for engineers Both are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\nFor customers, the tolerance for error is low. We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQuadrant 4: Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature Let’s start at the bottom.\nThis is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQuadrant 1: AI-first, Low-Stakes Tasks These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQuadrant 2: AI + Human is the Real Multiplier This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQuadrant 3: Human Judgment Still Matters This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q2 — but end up in Q3 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQuadrant 3: Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature Let’s start at the bottom.\nThis is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQuadrant 4: AI-first, Low-Stakes Tasks These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQuadrant 1: AI + Human is the Real Multiplier This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQuadrant 2: Human Judgment Still Matters This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q2 — but end up in Q3 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles.

After experimenting with platforms like Medium and Substack, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to move my blog to a new platform yet again. I\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed engaging on Twitter for nearly a decade, but the recent surge in toxicity and the dominance of influence-driven content have spurred me to seek a space where I can freely express my thoughts, free of algorithms dictating engagement.\nSo, I finally purchased my domain and it just felt right that I need to host my own content. My goal is to use this platform as a journal and make writing a habit, aiming for at least two posts per month and striving for a total of 20 posts by the end of 2024.\nWhat to Expect Today the internet has a sea of self-help content. While there are countless resources catering to beginners and plenty targeting senior leadership roles, there\u0026rsquo;s a dearth of material for those of us in the 5-20 year experience range.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQuadrant 3: Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature Let’s start at the bottom.\nThis is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQuadrant 4: AI-first, Low-Stakes Tasks These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQuadrant 1: AI + Human is the Real Multiplier This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQuadrant 2: Human Judgment Still Matters This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q3 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

We want to do 100 different things, but we have only so many hours every day. At work, most of our hours are governed by stakeholders and teammates. This is typical for most of us working in a product-engineering org.\nAn ideal day is when you work 100% on what you planned to achieve. But the reality is so much different.\nPropose a new idea for that feature Review the doc shared on Slack Read the interesting article Help out a new teammate get onboarded Learn that new tool and play around with it Handle escalations from stakeholders Prepare for leadership connects Think of ways to improve the team\u0026rsquo;s productivity The longer someone has been part of a team, the larger their laundry list becomes, and the more overwhelming it gets. There are so many random things which you need to get involved in whether you like or not. Morever, it is common knowledge that people who take the ownership of things beyond what is expected out of them, and add more value to their customers, are the ones who see faster growth in their careers.\nSo it is vital that we protect our time and focus on things that truly matter. Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQuadrant 3: Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature Let’s start at the bottom.\nThis is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQuadrant 4: AI-first, Low-Stakes Tasks These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQuadrant 1: AI + Human is the Real Multiplier This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQuadrant 2: Human Judgment Still Matters This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQuadrant 3: Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature Let’s start at the bottom - no AI, no humans needed\nThis is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQuadrant 4: AI-first, Low-Stakes Tasks These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQuadrant 1: AI + Human is the Real Multiplier This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQuadrant 2: Human Judgment Still Matters This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQuadrant 3: Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature Let’s start at the bottom - no AI, no humans needed\nThis is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: The LLM Sweet Spot These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQuadrant 1: AI + Human is the Real Multiplier This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQuadrant 2: Human Judgment Still Matters This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQ3: Let’s start at the bottom - no AI, no humans needed\nThis is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes. Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: The LLM Sweet Spot These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQuadrant 1: AI + Human is the Real Multiplier This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQuadrant 2: Human Judgment Still Matters This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQ3: Crutch Zone Let’s start at the bottom - no AI, no humans needed\nThis is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes. Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: The LLM Sweet Spot These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQuadrant 1: AI + Human is the Real Multiplier This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQuadrant 2: Human Judgment Still Matters This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"The era of agents - AI vs Humans"},{"content":"If you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of Severance, you’ll get the title. Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQ3: Crutch Zone (no AI, no humans needed) Let’s start at the bottom -\nThis is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes. Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: The LLM Sweet Spot These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQuadrant 1: AI + Human is the Real Multiplier This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQuadrant 2: Human Judgment Still Matters This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQ3: Crutch Zone (no AI, no humans) Let’s start at the bottom -\nThis is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes. Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: The LLM Sweet Spot These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQuadrant 1: AI + Human is the Real Multiplier This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQuadrant 2: Human Judgment Still Matters This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works.

My goal is to use this platform as a journal and make writing a habit, aiming for at least two posts per month and striving for a total of 20 posts by the end of 2024.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Hello"},{"content":"Welcome to my own little space on the internet.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQ3: Crutch Zone (no AI, no humans) Let’s start at the bottom. This is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes. Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: The LLM Sweet Spot These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQuadrant 1: AI + Human is the Real Multiplier This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQuadrant 2: Human Judgment Still Matters This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

We want to do 100 different things, but we have only so many hours every day. At work, most of our hours are governed by stakeholders and teammates. This is typical for most of us working in a product-engineering org.\nAn ideal day is when you work 100% on what you planned to achieve. But the reality is so much different.\nPropose a new idea for that feature Review the doc shared on Slack Read the interesting article Help out a new teammate get onboarded Learn that new tool and play around with it Handle escalations from stakeholders Prepare for leadership connects Think of ways to improve the team\u0026rsquo;s productivity The longer someone has been part of a team, the larger their laundry list becomes, and the more overwhelming it gets. There are so many random things which you need to get involved in whether you like or not. Morever, it is common knowledge that people who take the ownership of things beyond what is expected out of them, and add more value to their customers, are the ones who see faster growth in their careers.\nSo it is vital that we protect our time and focus on things that truly matter. Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQ3: Crutch Zone (no AI, no humans) Let’s start at the bottom. This is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes. Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: The LLM Sweet Spot (AI, no-humans) These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQuadrant 1: AI + Human is the Real Multiplier This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQuadrant 2: Human Judgment Still Matters This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

There are so many random things which you need to get involved in whether you like or not. Morever, it is common knowledge that people who take the ownership of things beyond what is expected out of them, and add more value to their customers, are the ones who see faster growth in their careers.\nSo it is vital that we protect our time and focus on things that truly matter. Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay. As the saying goes, \u0026lsquo;Plans are nothing; planning is everything.\u0026rsquo;\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/time/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWe all struggle with managing time.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQ3: Crutch Zone (low-AI, low-humans) Let’s start at the bottom. This is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes. Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: The LLM Sweet Spot (AI, no-humans) These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQuadrant 1: AI + Human is the Real Multiplier This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQuadrant 2: Human Judgment Still Matters This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQ3: Crutch Zone (low-AI, low-humans) Let’s start at the bottom. This is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes. Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: The LLM Sweet Spot (high-AI, low-humans) These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQuadrant 1: AI + Human is the Real Multiplier This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQuadrant 2: Human Judgment Still Matters This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQ3: Crutch Zone (low-AI, low-humans) Let’s start at the bottom. This is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes. Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: The LLM Sweet Spot (high-AI, low-humans) These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: The Combo Zone AI + Human is the Real Multiplier. This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQuadrant 2: Human Judgment Still Matters This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQ3: Crutch Zone (low-AI, low-humans) Let’s start at the bottom. This is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes. Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: The LLM Sweet Spot (high-AI, low-humans) These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: The Combo Zone (High-AI, High-humans) AI + Human is the Real Multiplier. This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQuadrant 2: Human Judgment Still Matters This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"The era of agents - AI vs Humans"},{"content":"If you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of Severance, you’ll get the title. Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQ3: Crutch Zone (low-AI, low-humans) Let’s start at the bottom. This is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes. Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: The LLM Sweet Spot (high-AI, low-humans) These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: The Combo Zone (High-AI, Maximum-humans) AI + Human is the Real Multiplier. This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQuadrant 2: Human Judgment Still Matters This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQ3: Crutch Zone (low-AI, low-humans) Let’s start at the bottom. This is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes. Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: The LLM Sweet Spot (high-AI, low-humans) These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: The Combo Zone (High-AI, Max-humans) AI + Human is the Real Multiplier. This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQuadrant 2: Human Judgment Still Matters This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works.

My goal is to use this platform as a journal and make writing a habit, aiming for at least two posts per month and striving for a total of 20 posts by the end of 2024.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Hello"},{"content":"Welcome to my own little space on the internet.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQ3: Crutch Zone (low-AI, low-humans) Let’s start at the bottom. This is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes. Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: The LLM Sweet Spot (high-AI, low-humans) These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: The Combo Zone (High-AI, High-humans) AI + Human is the Real Multiplier. This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQuadrant 2: Human Judgment Still Matters This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

We want to do 100 different things, but we have only so many hours every day. At work, most of our hours are governed by stakeholders and teammates. This is typical for most of us working in a product-engineering org.\nAn ideal day is when you work 100% on what you planned to achieve. But the reality is so much different.\nPropose a new idea for that feature Review the doc shared on Slack Read the interesting article Help out a new teammate get onboarded Learn that new tool and play around with it Handle escalations from stakeholders Prepare for leadership connects Think of ways to improve the team\u0026rsquo;s productivity The longer someone has been part of a team, the larger their laundry list becomes, and the more overwhelming it gets. There are so many random things which you need to get involved in whether you like or not. Morever, it is common knowledge that people who take the ownership of things beyond what is expected out of them, and add more value to their customers, are the ones who see faster growth in their careers.\nSo it is vital that we protect our time and focus on things that truly matter. Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQ3: Crutch Zone (low-AI, low-humans) Let’s start at the bottom. This is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes. Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: The LLM Sweet Spot (High-AI, Low-humans) These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: The Combo Zone (High-AI, High-humans) AI + Human is the Real Multiplier. This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQuadrant 2: Human Judgment Still Matters This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

There are so many random things which you need to get involved in whether you like or not. Morever, it is common knowledge that people who take the ownership of things beyond what is expected out of them, and add more value to their customers, are the ones who see faster growth in their careers.\nSo it is vital that we protect our time and focus on things that truly matter. Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay. As the saying goes, \u0026lsquo;Plans are nothing; planning is everything.\u0026rsquo;\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/time/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWe all struggle with managing time.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQ3: Crutch Zone (Low-AI, Low-humans) Let’s start at the bottom. This is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes. Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: The LLM Sweet Spot (High-AI, Low-humans) These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: The Combo Zone (High-AI, High-humans) AI + Human is the Real Multiplier. This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQuadrant 2: Human Judgment Still Matters This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQ3: Crutch Zone (Low-AI, Low-humans) Let’s start at the bottom. This is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes. Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: The LLM Sweet Spot (High-AI, Low-humans) These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: The Combo Zone (High-AI, High-humans) AI + Human is the Real Multiplier. This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQ2: Human Judgment Still Matters This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQ3: Crutch Zone (Low-AI, Low-humans) Let’s start at the bottom. This is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes. Pure Automation, Should’ve Been a Feature\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: The LLM Sweet Spot (High-AI, Low-humans) These are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: The Combo Zone (High-AI, High-humans) AI + Human is the Real Multiplier. This is the magic quadrant. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQ2: The Judgement Zone (High-Human, Low-AI) This quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nWhether you’re building for customers or for your own teams, maybe this framing helps you locate your problem — and more importantly, your leverage.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQ3: 🧱 Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn’t really need AI or humans — they only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: 🤖 The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: 🧠 The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo doesn\u0026rsquo;t just work — it compounds. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQ2: 👀 The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQ3: 🧱 Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn’t really need AI or humans — they only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: 🤖 The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: 🧠 The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo doesn\u0026rsquo;t just work — it compounds. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQ2: 👀 The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nUse it to decide what’s worth automating, what’s worth fixing, and what’s still worth doing the old school way.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQ3: 🧱 Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn’t really need AI or humans — they only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: 🤖 The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: 🧠 The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo doesn\u0026rsquo;t just work — it compounds. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQ2: 👀 The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nUse it to decide what’s worth automating, what’s worth fixing, and what’s still worth doing the old school way.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles.

After experimenting with platforms like Medium and Substack, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to move my blog to a new platform yet again. I\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed engaging on Twitter for nearly a decade, but the recent surge in toxicity and the dominance of influence-driven content have spurred me to seek a space where I can freely express my thoughts, free of algorithms dictating engagement.\nSo, I finally purchased my domain and it just felt right that I need to host my own content.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQ3: 🧱 Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn’t really need AI or humans — they only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: 🤖 The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: 🧠 The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo doesn\u0026rsquo;t just work — it compounds. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQ2: 👀 The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nUse it to decide what’s worth automating, what’s worth fixing, and what’s still worth doing the old school way.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

We want to do 100 different things, but we have only so many hours every day. At work, most of our hours are governed by stakeholders and teammates. This is typical for most of us working in a product-engineering org.\nAn ideal day is when you work 100% on what you planned to achieve. But the reality is so much different.\nPropose a new idea for that feature Review the doc shared on Slack Read the interesting article Help out a new teammate get onboarded Learn that new tool and play around with it Handle escalations from stakeholders Prepare for leadership connects Think of ways to improve the team\u0026rsquo;s productivity The longer someone has been part of a team, the larger their laundry list becomes, and the more overwhelming it gets. There are so many random things which you need to get involved in whether you like or not. Morever, it is common knowledge that people who take the ownership of things beyond what is expected out of them, and add more value to their customers, are the ones who see faster growth in their careers.\nSo it is vital that we protect our time and focus on things that truly matter. Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works.

We can’t afford to mess things up. Every touchpoint matters — understanding their language, reducing back and forth, empathising with their stress. The customer usually reaches out after they’ve tried everything else. It’s not enough to be correct — we have to help solve their problem.\nFor internal tooling (especially for engineers), we have more room to experiment and take risks. Developers are usually more forgiving if something fails gracefully, and the payoff for successful automation is massive. We’re aiming to 10x workflows, not just patch over gaps.\nNow, whether it’s external or internal, I started thinking: maybe the issue isn’t just about whether AI is “good enough”. Maybe it’s about understanding where AI should lead, where humans still shine, and when the combo works best.\nSo I drew this quadrant to make sense of the landscape.\nOn the X-axis, you’ve got how well AI can handle the problem. On the Y-axis, you’ve got how well humans still do. This isn’t just about customer support — it applies to all kinds of AI use cases: Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, you name it.\nQ3: 🧱 Crutch Zone Low AI, low human involvement\nThese are the problems that shouldn’t really need AI or humans — they only exist because of product gaps. This is where humans were in the loop only because the product didn’t support something directly. Think rule engines, deterministic workflows, status updates.\nThese problems don’t need AI. They need product fixes.\n\u0026ldquo;Resend OTP\u0026rdquo; — should be a button \u0026ldquo;Why is my email not verified?\u0026rdquo; — validation logic \u0026ldquo;Send alert if threshold breached\u0026rdquo; — config AI sometimes fills this gap, but it\u0026rsquo;s a crutch. It shouldn’t have to.\nQ4: 🤖 The LLM Sweet Spot High AI, minimal human involvement\nThese are classic LLM-friendly problems. There’s a clear set of data or logic. You can build RAG pipelines, plug into tools, and trust the answer most of the time.\n\u0026ldquo;Where’s my order?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I am not happy - issue a refund\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I update billing info?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What does this dashboard metric mean?\u0026rdquo; Small errors here don’t break the world. The AI gets it right often enough. And even when it doesn’t, users usually forgive.\nInternally, this is also where a lot of AI-assisted productivity happens — suggesting tests, cleaning up stale configs, renaming files, writing boilerplate. These are low-risk, high-reward.\nHere are some more examples we’ve seen work well:\nAuto-generating PR descriptions based on code diffs Writing quick integration tests from function signatures Creating GitHub issues or documentation stubs from internal Slack threads Parsing CI/CD logs and summarizing what went wrong Suggesting variable or function names aligned with repo conventions The key is: the problem has known structure, AI doesn’t need much context, and mistakes are cheap to fix.\nQ1: 🧠 The Combo Zone High AI, high human involvement\nThis is the quadrant where AI and humans amplify each other. The combo doesn\u0026rsquo;t just work — it compounds. AI does the grunt work, human makes the final call. With the right tools, a human can 10x their impact:\nA support agent becomes capable of resolving deeper technical issues A dev ships faster by offloading boilerplate and tests A smart intern can jump into fixing complex production issues These aren’t just \u0026ldquo;copilots\u0026rdquo; — they’re amplifiers. The combo wins.\nEspecially internally, this is where the biggest org productivity jumps can come from. But even on the customer side, we’re seeing signs — tools that make humans better, not just cheaper.\nQ2: 👀 The Judgment Zone High human judgment, low AI reliability\nThis quadrant is counterintuitive. You’d think everything eventually moves toward AI, right?\nBut there are still cases where humans outperform — not because the task is complex, but because the context or emotion isn’t obvious.\nA user has asked a simple question but is frustrated from past unresolved tickets A dispute needs context across teams, people, and old decisions A hotfix needs coordination and judgment under pressure Even if the AI gives the right answer, it might escalate things further. The issue isn’t what is said, but how and when it’s said.\nThe hard truth Most problems feel like they should sit in Q1 or Q4 — but end up in Q2 due to missing context.\nImagine a customer asking a straightforward question, but their past tickets haven’t been resolved. They’ve had to repeat themselves multiple times. The AI answers correctly — but it feels like a dead end.\nIf that context were available, the same problem could’ve easily been handled in one of the other quadrants.\nContext can shift a problem across quadrants.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the verdict? I think we’ve still got a year or two where humans play a critical role — helping make AI agents smarter and faster.\nThere’s no doubt we’re heading toward an AI-first future. It’s better to accept that and start adapting now.\nI keep asking engineers on my team: Are you writing code, or are you writing code that can write code?\nThis quadrant helped me — and my teams — decide where to push harder, where to let go, and where to slow down and reframe the problem.\nSome problems need better prompts. Some need better context. Some just need a human who knows when to say, \u0026ldquo;I get it. Let\u0026rsquo;s fix this.\u0026rdquo;\nUse it to decide what’s worth automating, what’s worth fixing, and what’s still worth doing the old school way.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-vs-humans-quadrant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn my org, I am responsible for using AI on two major fronts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo solve customer issues at scale\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo improve org productivity, especially for engineers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth are exciting and high-leverage areas — but the bar, expectations, and constraints differ wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor customers, the tolerance for error is low.

Your innie clocks in and does the job. Your outie lives the rest of your life, and the two never really know each other.\nSometimes I feel like my own version of that. I’ve spent so long optimising for the innie - work, productivity, performance. Only now starting to wonder: who is the outie? What does he enjoy, beyond the job, beyond the career?\nDisclaimer: mild introspection ahead. No fun, no learnings - just some Sunday ramblings.\nFor most Indian millennials, work is the default Like many others from a middle-class background, I grew up without a strong culture of hobbies or personal exploration. Focus on acing exams, pick a decent job, and everything else could come later - after you \u0026ldquo;settle down\u0026rdquo;.\nHere’s a simple prompt: Can you introduce yourself without mentioning your work? I never thought about it for the longest time. Most of the time, I would be like: \u0026ldquo;Hi, I am Kaushik from Bangalore, working at XYZ.\u0026rdquo; As if I were just a LinkedIn bio with a face.\nPassion was always secondary. Most days it was just me and my work. And if I had a weekend off, I would spend it figuring out how to be more productive - upskill, read more, make the most of whatever opportunity I had. I never cared much about titles or big hikes. But I always wanted to do meaningful work and do it well. If I had that, I felt I could keep going for years without complaining.\nIn recent years, my relationship with time shifted a bit, thanks to my wife. She loves travelling and she made sure I tagged along. I’ve come to enjoy it too - new places, people and culture, the outdoors, the sense of adventure, the break from routine. Both of us have fairly intense jobs, so we don’t get to travel as much as we would like. Travel is a great way to pause, reconnect with each other and the world. Not something we can do every day, but something that reminds me there’s more to life than Slack and Google Docs.\nWhat if I achieved FIRE today? I used to be surrounded by this small group at work who would almost every day talk about achieving financial independence (or “f**k you” money, as the FIRE guys love to call it). Every now and then I ask myself, and my friends - what would you do if you no longer had to work for money?\nMost people I know are content chasing their next real estate investment - not really my cup of tea. I often read on HN about how tech folks in the West spend their weekends on DIY hobbies - woodworking, fixing up cabins, or going camping. It sounds tempting - grounded, slow, intentional. But I genuinely can’t imagine doing that here. In Bangalore, just stepping out of the city takes the entire weekend.\nSo I am trying a new lens Not looking for one big passion or life plan. Just trying to pay closer attention.\nI stumbled across a post on Substack (thank you, Internet) that sparked this line of thinking. It gave me a simple but powerful way to reflect - without over-optimising or chasing clarity too soon. These are my own notes based on that.\n1. What gives me energy (and what drains it) Instead of “what’s my passion?”, I’ll try to notice what feels exciting and what feels like a chore.\nI plan to keep a low-stakes log for a couple of weeks. Nothing fancy, just quick notes on:\nWhat kinds of work make time fly What conversations leave me feeling recharged What I reach for when I’m not overthinking I also want to make a running list of things that drain me - tasks, environments, even people. The stuff that leaves me dull or distracted. Over time, this list should show me what I need to protect, and what I can slowly let go of.\n2. Follow my curiosity. Watch the rituals. Instead of hunting for a purpose, I want to keep trying things that spark curiosity and protect the rituals I enjoy.\nSome of the things I’ve picked up:\nCoffee brewing: The daily ritual of brewing beans and making a pour-over. I’m hoping there’s more here. Learning Japanese: Anime and TV got me hooked enough to enrol in a proper course. But I still deprioritise it when work gets busy. I want to make this a non-negotiable. Graphic Novels: Something very new. Want to be consistent, so trying something easy on the eye. And then there are the things that are part of my core identity but seem to be losing their spark:\nWhat do I actually enjoy about tech and startups? Maybe it’s the constraints and puzzle-solving. I say I love football, but I barely make time to watch a full match or play FIFA. Why is that? I enjoy the outdoors - trekking, cycling, or even a walk around the park. Why don’t I make more time for it? 3. Try a solo staycation and watch what happens Haven’t done this yet, but I want to. A quiet 24–48 hours alone. No obligations. Just time to wander, read, think, walk around. Stay somewhere that feels unfamiliar but not overwhelming. The idea isn’t to figure anything out - just to see what I gravitate toward when no one’s watching. Where my attention goes. What I reach for. Maybe that’ll say something I haven’t been able to articulate yet.\nI am starting today If you’re in the same boat - not stuck, not lost, just trying to see more clearly then maybe this helps. I’ll probably come back to this in a month and see if the blanks have started filling in.\nMy innie is great. He genuinely enjoys solving problems and has the drive and rigour to strive for excellence at work. But my outie needs to have a great personality too.\n(Yes, I know, this is a very forced Severance callback. But I’ve committed to the bit, so here we are.)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-outie/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of \u003cstrong\u003eSeverance\u003c/strong\u003e, you’ll get the title.

Most leadership literature focuses on how to be a good boss, but seldom addresses how to effectively help your team achieve their best. As engineering leaders responsible for a diverse team of super-smart engineers, we need to tailor our approach to each team member\u0026rsquo;s abilities and personalities.\nI recently attended a leadership workshop on \u0026ldquo;Situational Leadership\u0026rdquo; which made good sense. The idea is to indentify what stage of performance and maturity one\u0026rsquo;s team-members fit into and accordingly play a different role to help them succeed. The official docs are all fancy so I try to simplify this per my understanding.\nA good leader knows when to wear different hats - manager / coach / peer / enabler. Most managers micro-manage when they should be empowering someone or delegating when they should be giving directions. This frameowrk gives a mental model on how to think about this.\nFirst step is to draw a skill vs will matrix and identify which quadrant your team-members belong to. Skill refers to core-competency expected at one\u0026rsquo;s current role. Will refers to a broad range of things - willing to be a team player, excitement to take up new challenges, confidence on owning large projects etc\nS1: High-will but low-skill. These team members are typically freshers or individuals who have recently changed roles. They are enthusiastic about their new job and eager to learn. They need DIRECTION and sometimes even hand-holding until they can figure things out on their own.\nS2: Low-skill and low-will. These are your laggards. Be a COACH to them. A good coach pushes hard but also understands their limits. After a few cycles of feedback, you should evaluate if they are dragging the team down and if it is worth retaining them.\nS3: High-skill but low-will. These team members get things done and have potential, but they are not challenging themselves to go above and beyond. Sometimes, it may be due to a lack of exposure, and with the right opportunities, they can rise to the challenge. They need your SUPPORT and guidance. With the right motivation and alignment, they can push forward.\nS4: High-skill and high-will. These are your high performers and innovators. They not only get things done creatively but also identify new challenges for the team to tackle. You should DELEGATE some of your core/team responsibilities to them, giving them the opportunity to grow to the next level. These are the ones who create bandwidth for you to operate more strategically.\nSide note: it\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sign if an individual is going from one segment to another. It indicates that they are growing and taking up new challenges. On the contrary if someone is sitting in segment for too long, then that is something for the manager and the org to introspect about.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/skill-will/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am skeptical of frameworks that prescribe a one-size-fits-all approach to executing a role.

We want to do 100 different things, but we have only so many hours every day. At work, most of our hours are governed by stakeholders and teammates. This is typical for most of us working in a product-engineering org.\nAn ideal day is when you work 100% on what you planned to achieve. But the reality is so much different.\nPropose a new idea for that feature Review the doc shared on Slack Read the interesting article Help out a new teammate get onboarded Learn that new tool and play around with it Handle escalations from stakeholders Prepare for leadership connects Think of ways to improve the team\u0026rsquo;s productivity The longer someone has been part of a team, the larger their laundry list becomes, and the more overwhelming it gets. There are so many random things which you need to get involved in whether you like or not. Morever, it is common knowledge that people who take the ownership of things beyond what is expected out of them, and add more value to their customers, are the ones who see faster growth in their careers.\nSo it is vital that we protect our time and focus on things that truly matter. Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nMy Mental Model - The Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay. As the saying goes, \u0026lsquo;Plans are nothing; planning is everything.\u0026rsquo;\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/time/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWe all struggle with managing time.
