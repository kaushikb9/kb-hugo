There are so many random things which you need to get involved in whether you like or not. Morever, it is common knowledge that people who take the ownership of things beyond what is expected out of them, and add more value to their customers, are the ones who see faster growth in their careers.\nSo it is vital that you protect your time and focus on things that truly matter. Managing time is figuring out your priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you are at a very senior level.\nUnlocking your Zone of Genius I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you aim to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First, try to figure out this matrix for you - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Now try to plot all your tasks against this matrix. If you do it well then you get something like this P1: these are the things that move the needle - do everything you can to achieve these P2: important but may need not require you to do this all the time. What is the worst that can happen if you are not involved yourself? See if you can leverage your manager or peers to get this done with minimal involvement from your side. Don\u0026rsquo;t aim for perfection here P3: This is important for your own growth. Make time for it. If you are stretched too thin then talk to your manager on why this is important for you and get their buy-in to make progress (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Why does this even exist? Note: Daily planning rarely works. You will always be interrupted and your plans will go for a toss. Try to plan in weeks or even months if you Ihave that kind of visibility\nRe-evaluate this every few months, when you change teams or take up new roles. I try to use this mental model at the start of every week. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay. As the saying goes, \u0026lsquo;Plans are nothing; planning is everything.\u0026rsquo;\nMoral of the story - your day isn\u0026rsquo;t merely about ticking off tasks on a to-do list or closing Jira tickets. It\u0026rsquo;s about aligning your actions with your goals and aspirations. Through strategic thinking, playing to your strengths, and consistently seeking growth opportunities, you not only enhance your productivity as an engineer but also pave the path for long-term success. Time is your most valuable assetâ€”invest it wisely.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/time/","summary":"We all struggle with managing time.

After experimenting with platforms like Medium and Substack, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to move my blog to a new platform yet again. I\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed engaging on Twitter for nearly a decade, but the recent surge in toxicity and the dominance of influence-driven content have spurred me to seek a space where I can freely express my thoughts, free of algorithms dictating engagement.\nSo, I finally purchased my domain and it just felt right that I need to host my own content. My goal is to use this platform as a journal and make writing a habit, aiming for at least two posts per month and striving for a total of 20 posts by the end of 2024.\nWhat to Expect Today the internet has a sea of self-help content. While there are countless resources catering to beginners and plenty targeting senior leadership roles, there\u0026rsquo;s a dearth of material for those of us in the 5-20 year experience range. My aim is to fill that gap by sharing insights and reflections drawn from my own journey.\nThe individuals I work with and people in my inner-circle are already proficient in their fields.
