There are so many random things which you need to get involved in whether you like or not. Morever, it is common knowledge that people who take the ownership of things beyond what is expected out of them, and add more value to their customers, are the ones who see faster growth in their careers.\nSo it is vital that we protect our time and focus on things that truly matter. Managing time is all about figuring out priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out Urgent vs Important tasks - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you have a lot of autonomy with what you do.\nUnlocking your Zone of Genius This is the framework that I have been using for the last year. I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a book)\nOperate in Your Zone of Genius\nYour Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align.\nOperating in your Zone of Genius means playing games you are uniquely well-suited to win.\nOnce you identify it, you can stop playing *their* games and start playing *yours*.\n\u0026mdash; Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) October 16, 2021 I particulary like this line Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progeess. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay. As the saying goes, \u0026lsquo;Plans are nothing; planning is everything.\u0026rsquo;\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/time/","summary":"We all struggle with managing time.

After experimenting with platforms like Medium and Substack, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to move my blog to a new platform yet again. I\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed engaging on Twitter for nearly a decade, but the recent surge in toxicity and the dominance of influence-driven content have spurred me to seek a space where I can freely express my thoughts, free of algorithms dictating engagement.\nSo, I finally purchased my domain and it just felt right that I need to host my own content. My goal is to use this platform as a journal and make writing a habit, aiming for at least two posts per month and striving for a total of 20 posts by the end of 2024.\nWhat to Expect Today the internet has a sea of self-help content. While there are countless resources catering to beginners and plenty targeting senior leadership roles, there\u0026rsquo;s a dearth of material for those of us in the 5-20 year experience range. My aim is to fill that gap by sharing insights and reflections drawn from my own journey.\nThe individuals I work with and people in my inner-circle are already proficient in their fields. Through this blog, I hope to delve deeper into topics relevant to professionals who are still navigating their path to success.
