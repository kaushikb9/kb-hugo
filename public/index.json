The idea is that you play to your strengths while you work to unlock your next set of skills.\nExecuting the plan First step is to figure out my levers - it could be anything:\nmy interest vs my competence my goals vs team goals my learning vs team's outcome my sphere of influence vs impact for the org For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I have plotted it as me (everything that I want to do) vs org (everything that is expected out me) Next, I try to plot all my tasks against this matrix. I get something like this P1: Things that I am accountable for and things that will move the needle - I try my best to accomplish these P2: Important but may need not require my involvement all the time. I try to leverage my influence and see if it can be done without me spending too much time P3: This is important for my own growth and for long-term progress. I need to make time for it. If I am stretched too thin then I try to work with my manager and peers to get their buy-in (time, L\u0026amp;D budget, dedicated slots etc) P4: Ignore, question why does it even need any attention Note: Daily planning rarely works. I always try to plan in weeks or sometimes in months whenever possible\nI try to re-assess the overall strategy from a fresh lens whenever I change teams or take up new roles. I try to apply this mental model every Monday morning. There are weeks when things don\u0026rsquo;t go to plan, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay. As the saying goes, \u0026lsquo;Plans are nothing; planning is everything.\u0026rsquo;\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/time/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWe all struggle with managing time.
