      <description>We all struggle with managing time. We want to do 100 different things, but we have only so many hours every day. At work, most of our hours are governed by stakeholders and teammates. This is typical for most of us working in a product-engineering org.

Propose a new idea for that feature Review the doc shared on Slack Read the interesting article Help out a new teammate get onboarded Learn that new tool and play around with it Squash some bugs and add more tests Refactor that code you always wanted to Think of ways to improve the team&amp;rsquo;s productivity The longer someone has been part of a team, the larger their laundry list becomes, and the more overwhelming it gets.</description>

      <description>Hello! I am a startup guy from Bangalore who cant stop talking about the booming fintech sector and the worsening traffic situation. When I am not working I am playing FIFA or running on the streets of Bangalore practicing for a marathon. I love evangelizing the need to build impactful solutions - for the world, from India.
This is an attempt to write regularly. I aim to post at least at least small post</description>
