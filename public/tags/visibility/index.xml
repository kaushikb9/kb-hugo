      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I was chatting with a small group of folks, early to mid-level engineers trying to figure out how to grow without getting stuck in the “just keep grinding” loop. The one where you work hard, stay low-key, and hope someone notices. So I wrote down a bunch of thoughts based on what’s helped some of the best in my team get noticed and grow faster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is one thing I’ve learned, it’s this: hard work is rarely the problem. Most people are already putting in the hours. But visibility, leverage and momentum? That’s where things start to click.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
