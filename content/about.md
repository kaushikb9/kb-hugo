Welcome to my own little space on the internet. I take deep interest in all things startups, engineering, football and outdoors.

I have been part of few interesting companies where I led teams working on a wide range of engineering problems - ranging from building products  for PMF to serving millions of requests everyday. I am currently an Associate Director of Engineering at one of India's largest fintech companies
