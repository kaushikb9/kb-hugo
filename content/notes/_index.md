summary: A personal space where I document reflections from the trenches — because the real learning isn’t in threads or conference halls, but in the raw, everyday stories unfolding at work.
---

For a long time, I felt like I wasn’t making the most of being in the startup ecosystem.  I wasn’t building an online audience. I wasn’t attending enough meetups. I wasn’t tracking the next big hype closely enough.

But somewhere along the way, I started noticing something:  The real learning and value didn’t come from conferences or perfectly structured Twitter threads.  It was happening quietly — in the trenches, at work.

- In internal escalation groups  
- On calls with frustrated customers  
- During monthly staff meetings  
- In war rooms, where urgency sparked creativity  

Eventually, I stopped looking outward for inspiration and started paying closer attention to what was unfolding around me. Noticing patterns. Asking better questions. Learning from the work itself. This space is where I capture those reflections.


## ✨ What surprised me at work?

That’s the only question I’m starting with. Idea is to something that caught me off guard — a story, a detail, an insight, a bug, a pattern, or a conversation that made me think differently. These won’t be long-form essays. Just byte-sized notes — quick to write, rough around the edges, and published without overthinking. Sometimes the surprises are small. Sometimes they poke at bigger beliefs. Either way, they’re worth writing down.

Thanks for dropping by. This is a quiet space. No hacks. No frameworks. Just thinking in progress.
