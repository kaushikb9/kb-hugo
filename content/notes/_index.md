summary: A personal space where I document reflections from the trenches — because the real learning isn’t in threads or conference halls, but in the stories unfolding everyday.
---

This section is a place where I publish my raw notes and thoughts from day-to-day interactions and experiences. These are not long-form essays which go into the main blog. Just byte-sized notes - quick to write, rough around the edges, and published without overthinking. This is primarily inspired by the concept of [Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes)

### 🤔 What will you find here?

For a long time, I felt like I wasn’t making the most of being in the startup ecosystem.  I wasn’t building an online audience. I wasn’t attending enough meetups. I wasn’t tracking the next big hype closely enough.

But somewhere along the way, I started noticing something:  The real learning and value didn’t come from conferences or perfectly structured Twitter threads.  It was happening quietly — in the trenches, at work.

- In internal escalation groups  
- On calls with frustrated customers  
- During monthly staff meetings  
- In war rooms, where urgency sparked creativity  

Eventually, I stopped looking outward for inspiration and started paying closer attention to what was happening around me - noticing patterns, asking better questions, learning from everyday work and life. This space is where I capture those reflections. 

tl;dr: **What surprised me this week?** - that’s the only question I’m starting with. Idea is to write about something that caught me off guard — a story, an insight, a bug, a pattern, a tweet or a conversation that made me think differently. Sometimes the surprises are small. Sometimes they poke at bigger beliefs. Either way, they’re worth writing down.

Thanks for dropping by. This is a quiet space. No hacks. No frameworks. Just thinking in progress.
