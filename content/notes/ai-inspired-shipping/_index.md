This is a quick scribble of how an AI tool sparked creativity, broke old habits, and reminded us that moving fast inspires better thinking


At most tech companies, productivity problems don’t explode overnight. They sneak in: PRs stuck in limbo, lengthy documents, broken testing, and context switching that quietly chips away at momentum.

So, like many teams, we turned to AI tools.

**Copilot** was the natural first step. It was stable, battle-tested, and backed by Microsoft. It worked across editors, came with solid documentation, and made enterprise buyers feel safe with its audit logs and policy controls. It checked all the boxes. But engineers needed a lot of push. Multiple L&D sessions, official training lessons but traction was super-slow

Then someone gave **Cursor** a try. It wasn’t perfect. It had guardrails, but still lacked the polish of a true enterprise rollout. There were no user-level pricing caps, no insights on usage, admins couldn't control model usage tightly. But developers? They didn’t care.

Because Cursor didn’t just assist with code. It **changed how people thought**.

- You could chat with your codebase.
- Ask “What does this service even do?” and *get an actual answer*.
- Refactor full files without fighting context switches.
- Onboard into an unfamiliar repo without a human tour guide.

And it didn’t stop there.

Suddenly, devs weren’t just shipping faster. They were **dreaming faster**.

Teams spun up their own **MCP servers** to power Cursor use cases.  
Ideas for **auto-documentation via prompts** became hallway conversations.  
Someone even built **LLM fine-tuning** on internal service patterns — just because Cursor made it feel within reach.

It wasn't the most complete tool. It was fast. And that made all the difference.

**Copilot still has a place**, especially for completions or JetBrains loyalists. But when asked, “Would you give up your Cursor license for anything else?”— the answer was always "Never"

So we leaned in. Not because it was flawless. But because it created motion.

### So what’s the lesson?

- **Speed of iteration > completeness of features**  

You win by making people faster, sharper, and a little more curious.

Be the tool that unlocks momentum.
Be the one they talk about.
**Be the one that ships**
