We all struggle with managing time. We want to do 100 different things, but we have only so many hours every day. At work, most of our hours are governed by stakeholders and teammates. This is typical for most of us working in a product-engineering org.

An ideal day is when you work 100% on what you planned to achieve. But the reality is so much different.
- Propose a new idea for that feature
- Review the doc shared on Slack
- Read the interesting article
- Help out a new teammate get onboarded
- Learn that new tool and play around with it
- Squash some bugs and add more tests
- Refactor that code you always wanted to
- Think of ways to improve the team's productivity

The longer someone has been part of a team, the larger their laundry list becomes, and the more overwhelming it gets. There are so many random things which you need to get involved in whether you like or not. Morever, it is common knowledge that people who take the ownership of things beyond what is expected out of them, and add more value to their customers, are the ones who see faster growth in their careers. 

So it is vital that you protect your time and focus on things that truly matter. Managing time is figuring out your priorities. The question is how? The first advice everyone gives is to figure out [Urgent vs Important tasks](https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/) - delegate more and schedule time for the ones you want to focus on. But it gets hard to properly adopt this framework unless you are at a very senior level. 

## Unlocking your `Zone of Genius`

I first came across this term in a tweet (the concept comes from a [book](https://www.amazon.in/Genius-Zone-Breakthrough-Negative-Creativity/dp/1250246547))

I particulary like this line **Your Zone of Genius is where your interests, passions and skills align**. The idea is that you play to your strengths while you aim to unlock your next set of skills. 

## Executing the plan

First, try to figure out this matrix for you - it could be anything:
- `my interest` vs `my competence`
- `my goals` vs `team goals`
- `my learning` vs `team's outcome`
- `my sphere of influence` vs `impact for the org`

For simplicity's sake, I have plotted it as `me` *(everything that I want to do)* vs `org` *(everything that is expected out me)*

Now try to plot all your tasks against this matrix. If you do it well then you get something like this

- P1: these are the things that move the needle - do everything you can to achieve these
- P2: important but may need not require you to do this all the time. What is the worst that can happen if you are not involved yourself? See if you can leverage your manager or peers to get this done with minimal involvement from your side. Don't aim for perfection here
- P3: This is important for your own growth. Make time for it. If you are stretched too thin then talk to your manager on why this is important for you and get their buy-in to make progress (time, L&D budget, dedicated slots etc)
- P4: Why does this even exist?

**Note**: Daily planning rarely works. You will always be interrupted and your plans will go for a toss. 
Try to plan in weeks or even months if you Ihave that kind of visibility

Re-evaluate this every few months, when you change teams or take up new roles. I try to use this mental model at the start of every week. There are weeks when things don't go to plan, but that's okay. As the saying goes, 'Plans are nothing; planning is everything.' 

Moral of the story - your day isn't merely about ticking off tasks on a to-do list or closing Jira tickets. It's about aligning your actions with your goals and aspirations. Through strategic thinking, playing to your strengths, and consistently seeking growth opportunities, you not only enhance your productivity as an engineer but also pave the path for long-term success. Time is your most valuable assetâ€”invest it wisely.
